	<title>Making A Fire</title>
	<lyrics>I've been waiting, elevating
Hanging on the line
Hate to say it
Your new favorite's going out of style
Threw away those broken heroes
They're just wood and wires
Hallelujah
Spread the news but don't believe the hype
Alright

Are you afraid of the dark?
I know a place we can start

But if this is the last time
Make up your mind
I've waited a lifetime to live
It's time to ignite
I'm making a fire

I was begging when I said I'd never tell a lie
Luck be damned
I took a stand and finally hit my stride
Bye, bye

Are you afraid of the dark?
I know a place we can start

But if this is the last time
Make up your mind
I've waited a lifetime to live
It's time to ignite
I'm making a fire

Are you afraid of the dark?
I know a place we can start

So if this is the last time
Make up your mind
I've waited a lifetime to live
It's down to the wire

This is the last time
I've made up my mind
I've waited a lifetime to live
It's time to ignite
I'm making a fire</lyrics>

	<title>Shame Shame</title>
	<lyrics>If you want to
I'll make you feel something real just to bother you
Now I got you
Under my thumb, like a drug, I will smother you
I'll be the one
Be the moon, be the sun
Be the rain in your song
Go and put that record on
If you want to
I'll be the one
Be the tongue that will swallow you

Shame, shame
Shame, shame
Shame, shame
Shame, shame

Another splinter under the skin
Another season of loneliness
I found a reason and buried it
Beneath a mountain of emptiness

Shame, shame
Shame, shame

Who? What? (Shame)
Where? When? (Shame)
Just move along, nothing wrong (Shame)
Till we meet again (Shame)
I'll be the end (Shame, shame)
I'll be the war at your door (Shame)
Come and let me in (Shame)
I'll be the one (Shame)
Be the moon, be the sun (Shame)
Be the rain in your song (Shame)
Go and put that record on (Shame)
If you want to (Shame, shame)
I'll be the one (Shame)
Be the tongue that will swallow you (Shame)

Another splinter under the skin
Another season of loneliness
I found a reason and buried it
Beneath a mountain of emptiness

Shame, shame
Shame, shame
Shame, shame
Shame, shame
Shame, shame
Shame, shame
Shame, shame
Shame, shame

Another splinter under the skin
Another season of loneliness
I found a reason and buried it
Beneath a mountain of emptiness

Shame, shame
Shame, shame
Shame, shame
Shame, shame</lyrics>

	<title>Cloudspotter</title>
	<lyrics>Big baby, run and hide
Hope it don't sting when the feeling dies
I got sweet dreams tucked in tight
Silver screen sister in a suit and tie
Two lovers, sick and tired
Standing in the mirror, it's my good side
Match made in heaven, show me the light
Burn me right down like a house on fire
Cloudspotter (Cloudspotter)
Cloudspotter (Cloudspotter)
Burn me right down like a house on fire
Cloudspotter
Cloudspotter

Calling on someone else's dime
Put your two cents where the sun don't shine

Swing, swing, guillotine queen
Swinging from the left to the right
Bang, bang, bang, you're so mean
Don't we look good? Don't we look good?
Swing, swing, guillotine queen
Cut me back down to size
Bang, bang, bang, know what I mean?
Don't we look good? Don't we look good?
Cloudspotter

Head ringing in the dead of night
Just a pair of lovesick parasites
Put me on hold, hold on tight
Everything's wrong when you've got no right
Cloudspotter (Cloudspotter)
Cloudspotter (Cloudspotter)
Everything's wrong when you've got no right
Cloudspotter
Cloudspotter

I need to know, but I don't ask why
Refuse me while I kiss the sky

Swing, swing, guillotine queen
Swinging from the left to the right
Bang, bang, bang, you're so mean
Don't we look good? Don't we look good?
Swing, swing, guillotine queen
Cut me back down to size
Bang, bang, bang, know what I mean?
Don't we look good? Don't we look good?
Cloudspotter
Cloudspotter

I need to know, but I don't ask why
Refuse me while I kiss the sky

Swing, swing, guillotine queen
Swinging from the left to the right
Bang, bang, bang, you're so mean
Don't we look good? Don't we look good?
Swing, swing, guillotine queen
Cut me back down to size
Bang, bang, bang, know what I mean?
Don't we look good? Don't we look good?

	<title>Waiting On A War</title>
	<lyrics>I've been waiting on a war since I was young
Since I was a little boy with a toy gun
Never really wanted to be number one
Just wanted to love everyone

Is there more to this than that?
Is there more to this than that?
Is there more to this than that?
Is there more to this
More to this, more to this than
Just waiting on a war?
Just waiting on a war?

Every day waiting for the sky to fall
Big crash on a world that's so small
Just a boy with nowhere left to go
Fell in love with a voice on the radio

Is there more to this than that?
Is there more to this than that?
Is there more to this than that?
Is there more to this
More to this, more to this than
Just waiting on a war?
Just waiting on a war?

Just waiting on a war for this and that
There's got to be more to this than that
Just waiting on a war for this and that
There's got to be more to this than that

I've been waiting on a war since I was young
Since I was a little boy with a toy gun

Is there more to this
More to this, more to this than
Just waiting on a war?
Just waiting on a war?

Just waiting on a war for this and that
There's got to be more to this than that
Just waiting on a war for this and that
There's got to be more to this than that
Just waiting on a war for this and that
There's got to be more to this than that
Just waiting on a war for this and that
There's got to be more to this than that

Because I need more
Yeah, I need more
Just waiting on a war
Just waiting on a war
Yeah, I need more
(For this and that
There's got to be more to this than that
Just waiting on a war)
Yeah, I need more
(For this and that
There's got to be more to this than that
Just waiting on a war)</lyrics>

	<title>Medicine At Midnight</title>
	<lyrics>Say a prayer and close the light
Thumb upon the scale
The pillow is cold
That ship has sailed
Time has run the river dry
Dry as a twisted trail
Into the bone
I'm into it

Ever get the feeling nothing else will do?
I could hear you singing
Pink turned to blue
Was it your graffiti?
Did you write your name?
On the dirty ceiling
I can't explain, I need

Medicine at midnight
But it ain't no cure
Medicine at midnight calling
But it ain't no cure
I may be sick, but you know I'm yours

I remember dancing hard
Under the Dead Moon
Howling with you
Howling

Ever get the feeling nothing else will do?
I could hear you singing
I can't explain, I need

Medicine at midnight
But it ain't no cure
Medicine at midnight howling
But it ain't no cure
I may be sick, but you know I'm yours

Rain on the dance floor, back against the ropes
Rain on the dance floor, back against the ropes
Rain on the dance floor, back against the ropes
Rain on the dance floor, back against the ropes
Rain on the dance floor, back against the ropes

Medicine at midnight
But it ain't no cure
Medicine at midnight howling
But it ain't no cure
I may be sick, but you know I'm yours

Rain on the dance floor, back against the ropes
Rain on the dance floor, back against the ropes</lyrics>

	<title>No Son Of Mine</title>
	<lyrics>No son of mine will ever do
The work of villains, the will of fools
If you believe it, it must be true
No son of mine, no son of mine

No son of mine will ever need
To beg forgiveness, no wicked deed
Head full of evil, heart full of greed
No son of mine, no son of mine

Here we are, living dead
Hand to God with one foot in the grave
Age of lost innocence
Don't forget what your good book says

No son of mine
No son of mine
No son of mine
No son of mine

No son of mine will ever be
Under the power vested in thee
March into slaughter down on his knees
No son of mine, no son of mine

Here we are, living dead
Hand to God with one foot in the grave
Age of lost innocence
Don't forget what your good book says

No son of mine
No son of mine
No son of mine
No son of mine

No son of mine will ever say
Words of illusion, oh, this I pray
Heretofore taking my name in vain
No son of mine, no son of mine

Here we are, living dead
Hand to God with one foot in the grave
Age of lost innocence
Don't forget what your good book says

No son of mine
No son of mine
No son of mine
No son of mine
No son of mine
No son of mine
No son of mine
No son of mine</lyrics>

	<title>Holding Poison</title>
	<lyrics>I got this thing and I've been taking it out on you
Taking it out on you, poor you
Like a machine that's always breaking down on you
Breaking down on you, so true

I spin around, around, around
Spin around, around, around
Spin around, around, around
And then out of the blue

Holding the poison down
Holding the poison down
Something to drown you out
I'm holding the poison down
You know I want what I want, I get what I get
You know what I mean? I meant what I said
Holding the poison down
Holding the poison down

I get the feeling that there ain't nothing that I can do
Nothing will get me through, so blue
Sometimes I dream, I can dream, I can dream
And then I bleed, and I bleed, and I bleed
I get the feeling that there ain't nothing that I can do

I spin around, around, around
Spin around, around, around
Spin around, around, around
Out of the blue

Holding the poison down
Holding the poison down
Something to drown you out
I'm holding the poison down
You know I want what I want, I get what I get
You know what I mean? I meant what I said
Holding the poison down
Holding the poison down

Stand around, around, around
Stand around, around, around
Stand around, around, around
Out of the blue

Holding the poison down
Holding the poison down
Something to drown you out
I'm holding the poison down
You know I want what I want, I get what I get
You know what I mean? I meant what I said
Holding the poison down
Holding the poison down</lyrics>

	<title>Chasing Birds</title>
	<lyrics>Chasing birds to get high
My head is in the clouds
Chasing birds to get by
I'm never coming down

My heart is six feet underground
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
Dark inventions of mine
The road to hell is paved with broken parts
Bleeding hearts like mine

Chasing birds through the sky
And deep into the black
Chasing birds, say goodbye
I'm never coming back

Here comes another heart attack
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
Dark inventions of mine
The road to hell is paved with broken parts
Bleeding hearts like mine

Chasing birds to get high
I'm never coming down

My heart is six feet underground
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
Dark inventions of mine
The road to hell is paved with broken parts
Bleeding hearts like mine

Chasing birds
Chasing birds
Chasing birds
Chasing birds
Chasing birds
Chasing birds</lyrics>

	<title>Love Dies Young</title>
	<lyrics>Love dies young and there's no resuscitation
Once it's done, no regeneration
It's a losing game that'll make you play
Your hand against your chest, love dies young

Love dies young and there's no reanimation
Once it's gone, no regeneration
It's a bitter kiss that'll make you wish
You never had a taste

Love dies young
Love dies young
Please don't take my breath
Don't take my breath away
Love dies young

Love's so dumb so what's the fascination
Leaves you numb with a nasty reputation
When you lose your head and lights go out
You'll never be the same

Love dies young
Love dies young
Please don't take my breath
Don't take my breath away
Love dies young

Never-ending cemeteries, funeral parades
All your dreams are buried in their place

Love dies young
Love dies young
Please don't take my breath
Don't take my breath away
Love dies young

Love dies young
Love dies young
Please don't take my breath
Don't take my breath away
Love dies young

Love dies young
Love dies young
Love dies young
Love dies young
Love dies young
Love dies young
Love dies young
Love dies young</lyrics>
